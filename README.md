# Animal Sanctuary Project
 
 ## Description
 Animal sanctuary is an object oriented program that was designed to take input from the user which allows them to create and list animals within the sanctaury, and to call an attendant to make their rounds with feeding the objects that have been created. 
 ## Technologies Used
 - Java
 - Eclipse
 - Git/Github
 - Sublime Text Editor
 - zsh
 ## Concepts Applied
 - Object oriented programming (Abstraction, Polymorpheism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation)
 - Condtional statements
 - For loops
 ## Lessons Learned
 Object oriented progamming can easily get a bit confusing and maybe even a bit dizzying. However, when it comes to debugging your code, it helps make more sense of it.
